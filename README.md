# Lateral-displacement-of-vehicle
## Introduction
Studied the camera Pinhole model.
● Determine the Internal camera
parameters by camera calibration.
● Did the inverse perspective mapping
of video frames and proposed the
methodologies for determining the
lateral displacement and heading
angle of the vehicle using MATLAB
and simulated the algorithm.
